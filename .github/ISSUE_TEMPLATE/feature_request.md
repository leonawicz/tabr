<!--

Before filing a feature request, please consider if it fits the scope of the package, conforms to package syntax rules, and is of general utility to other users.

1. Do you want to alter `tabr` music notation syntax?

Writing your own external code that wraps around package funcationality is the recommended approach if you require something that customized.

2. Do you want to alter the LilyPond markup generated by `tabr`?

`tabr` is not intended for full generality when generating LilyPond markup. Consider using LilyPond directly. The `lilypond()` function also allows you create a LilyPond file without rendering. This enables you to edit the output if `tabr` cannot meet your specific needs.
