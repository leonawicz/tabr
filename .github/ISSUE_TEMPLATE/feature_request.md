<!--

Before filing a feature request, please consider if it fits the scope of the package, conforms to package syntax rules, and is of general utility to many other users. This is especially true for transcription related requests. These are a couple common reasons feature requests may be declined.

1. Do you want to alter the string of LilyPond syntax generated by the package? Can your problem be reformulated?

`tabr` is not intended for full generality when generating LilyPond markup. Consider using LilyPond directly. The `lilypond()` function also allows you create a LilyPond file without rendering. This enables you to edit the output if `tabr` cannot meet your specific needs.

2. Do you want your own unique music syntax?

Ad hoc additions to the package syntax rules mainly cause confusion and don't benefit users in general. `tabr` has syntax converters that are officially supported, but these are reserved for yntax formats like music21 that are used and understood by many people. Several users have made their own external wrappers around `tabr` functions to meet their unique needs. This is the recommended approach in such cases.
