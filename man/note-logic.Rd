\description{
Relational operators for comparing two noteworthy class objects.
}
\details{
Equality is assessed in the same manner as used for \code{\link[=note_sort]{note_sort()}} when
sorting pitches. What matters is the underlying semitone value associated
with each pitch, not the string notation such as flat vs. sharp (see
\code{\link[=pitch_is_identical]{pitch_is_identical()}}). When comparing chords, or a chord vs. a single note,
comparison favors the root. Comparison is made of the respective lowest
pitches, then proceeds to the next pitch if equal.

For these operators, the objects on the left and right side of the operator
must both be \code{noteworthy} or an error is returned.

The examples include a chord with its pitches entered out of pitch order.
This does not affect the results because pitches within chords are sorted
before note to note comparisons at each timestep are done between \code{e1} and
\code{e2}.
