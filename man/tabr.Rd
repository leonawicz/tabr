\title{tabr: Music Notation Syntax, Manipulation, Analysis and Transcription in R}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Provides a music notation syntax and a collection of music programming functions for generating, manipulating, organizing, and analyzing musical information in R. Music syntax can be entered directly in character strings, for example to quickly transcribe short pieces of music. The package contains functions for directly performing various mathematical, logical and organizational operations and musical transformations on special object classes that facilitate working with music data and notation. The same music data can be organized in tidy data frames for a familiar and powerful approach to the analysis of large amounts of structured music data. Functions are available for mapping seamlessly between these formats and their representations of musical information. The package also provides an API to 'LilyPond' (\url{https://lilypond.org/}) for transcribing musical representations in R into tablature ("tabs") and sheet music. 'LilyPond' is open source music engraving software for generating high quality sheet music based on markup syntax. The package generates 'LilyPond' files from R code and can pass them to the 'LilyPond' command line interface to be rendered into sheet music PDF files or inserted into R markdown documents. The package offers nominal MIDI file output support in conjunction with rendering sheet music. The package can read MIDI files and attempts to structure the MIDI data to integrate as best as possible with the data structures and functionality found throughout the package.
