\title{Fold and unfold strings}
\usage{
string_unfold(x)

string_fold(x, n = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{character string, should be valid notes or note info such as beats.}

\item{n}{integer, minimum number of consecutive repeated values to warrant
folding, defaults to 3.}
}
\value{
character
}
\description{
Fold or unfold a string on the expansion operator.
}
\details{
These function work on arbitrary stings. They do not perform a noteworthy
check. This allows them to work for \code{info} strings as well. Make sure
your strings are properly formatted. \code{string_fold()} always collapses the
output string as space-delimited.
