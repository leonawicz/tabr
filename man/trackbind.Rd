\description{
Bind together track tables by row.
}
\details{
This function appends multiple track tables into a single track table for
preparation of generating a multi-track score. \code{id} is used to separate
staves in the sheet music/tablature output. A track's \code{voice} is used to
separate distinct voices within a common music staff.

If not provided, \code{id} automatically propagates \code{1:n} for \code{n} tracks passed to
\code{...} when binding these tracks together. This expresses the default
assumption of one staff or music/tab staff pair per track. This is the
typical use case.

Some tracks represent different voices that share the same staff.
These should be assigned the same \code{id}, in which case you must
provide the \code{id} argument. Up to two voices per track are supported.
An error will be thrown if any two tracks have both the same \code{voice}
and the same \code{id}. The pair must be unique. E.g., provide \code{id = c(1, 1)} when
you have two tracks with \code{voice} equal to 1 and 2. See examples.

Note that the actual ID values assigned to each track do not matter;
only the order in which tracks are bound, first to last.
