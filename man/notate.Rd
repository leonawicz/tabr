\details{
This function binds text annotation in LilyPond syntax to a note's
associated \code{info} entry.
Technically, the syntax is a hybrid form, but is later updated safely and
unambiguously to LilyPond syntax with respect to the rest of the note info
substring when it is fed to \code{phrase()} for musical phrase assembly.
