\title{Generate a chord set}
\usage{
chord_set(x, id = NULL, n = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{character, n-string chord description from lowest to highest pitch,
strings n through 1. E.g., \code{"xo221o"}. You can use spaces or semicolons
when 2-digit fret numbers are present, e.g., \code{"8 10 10 9 o"}. Do not mix
formats. Leading \code{x} are inferred if the number of entries is less than \code{n}.}

\item{id}{character, the name of the chord in LilyPond readable format,
e.g., \code{"a:m"}. Ignored if \code{x} is already a named vector.}

\item{n}{number of instrument strings.}
}
\value{
a named list.
}
\description{
Generate a chord set for a music score.
}
\details{
The chord set list returned by \code{chord_set()} is only used for top center
placement of a full set of chord fretboard diagrams for a music score.
\code{chord_set()} returns a named list. The names are the chords and the list
elements are strings defining string and fret fingering readable by LilyPond.
Multiple chord positions can be defined for the same chord name.
Instruments with a number of strings other than six are not currently
supported.

When defining chords, you may also wish to define rests or silent rests for
chords that are to be added to a score for placement above the staff in
time, where no chord is to be played or explicitly written.
Therefore, there are occasions where you may pass chord names and positions
that happen to include entries \code{r} and/or \code{s} as \code{NA} as shown in the
example. These two special cases are passed through by \code{chord_set()} but are
ignored when the chord chart is generated.
