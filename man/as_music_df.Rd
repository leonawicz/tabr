\usage{
as_music_df(
  notes,
  info = NULL,
  key = NULL,
  scale = "diatonic",
  chords = c("root", "list", "character"),
  si_format = c("mmp_abb", "mmp", "ad_abb", "ad")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{notes}{character, a noteworthy string. Alternatively, a music object
or a phrase object, in which case \code{info} is ignored.}

\item{info}{\code{NULL} or character, a note info string.}

\item{key}{character, key signature, only required for inclusion of scale
degrees.}

\item{scale}{character, defaults to \code{"diatonic"}. Only used in conjunction
with \code{key}, this can be used to alter scale degrees. Not any arbitrary
combination of valid \code{key} and valid \code{scale} is valid. See \code{\link[=scale_degree]{scale_degree()}}.}

\item{chords}{character, how to structure columns containing multiple values
per chord/row of data frame. See details.}

\item{si_format}{character, format for scale intervals. See
\code{\link[=scale_interval]{scale_interval()}}.}
}
\value{
a tibble data frame
}
\description{
Convert a noteworthy string to a tibble data frame and include additional
derivative variables.
}
\details{
If \code{info} is provided or \code{notes} is a phrase object, the resulting data frame
also contains note durations and other info variables. The \code{duration} column
is always included in the output even as a vector of \code{NA}s when \code{info = NULL}.
This makes it more explicit that a given music data frame was generated
without any time information for the timesteps. Other note info columns are
not included in this case.

For some derived column variables the root note (lowest pitch) in chord is
used. This is done for pitch intervals and scale intervals between adjacent
timesteps. This also occurs for scale degrees.

\code{chord = "root"} additionally collapses columns like semitone, octave, and
frequency to the value for the root note so that all rows contain one numeric
value. \code{chord = "list"} retains full information as list columns.
\code{chord = "character"} collapses into strings so that values are readily
visible when printing the table, but information is not stripped and can be
recovered without recomputing from the original pitches.
