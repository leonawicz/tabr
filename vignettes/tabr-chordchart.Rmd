The `plot_fretboard()` function can be used to create general fretboard diagrams directly in R using ggplot and `plot_chord()` specifically produces single chord diagrams, but this vignette shows how to create a standalone chord chart using LilyPond. Instead of using `tab()` to render a score to pdf that may contain a chord chart at the top of the first page, you can use `render_chordchart()`. This function creates the necessary LilyPond file and sends it to LilyPond for final rendering.

## Prepare chords

For consistency, `render_chordchart()` takes chord input in the same way that `score()` does, as a named character vector. The chords and their names are in the same format.

Filter the `guitarChords` dataset down to chords:

* whose root note is either C or F
* the chords is either a 7th, major 7th, or minor 7th
* the chords do not contain sharps
* and the fret number of the root note is no higher than 12

```{r chords}
library(dplyr)

chords <- filter(
  guitarChords, 
  root %in% c("c", "f") & 
    id %in% c("7", "M7", "m7") &
    !grepl("#", notes) & root_fret <= 12
  ) |>
  arrange(root, id)

chords <- setNames(chords$fretboard, chords$lp_name)
head(chords)
```

## Render chord chart

The filtering above results in 41 chords. The size of the fretboard diagrams is increased below with `size = 2`. Like `lilypond()` and the `render_*` functions that wrap around it for rendering music scores, `render_chordchart()` also takes the `header` and `paper` named list arguments. Once the named chord vector is ready, rendering the chord chart is as simple as the following.

```{r chordchart, eval=FALSE}
hdr <- list(
  title = "Dominant 7th, major 7th and minor 7th chords",
  subtitle = "C and F root"
)
render_chordchart(chords, "out.png", 2, hdr, list(textheight = 175))
```

The chord chart template must be kept to one page.
